2) Project Title and Description
- Stock Market Trading Bot
- The idea behind this project is to develop a web application where users can go in and create their 
  own portfolio of stocks from a handful of available options to be traded by a ML bot. The bot will 
  track 1 minute tickers of the stock data and day trade based on the assumption a stock will always 
  fall back to its mean price (if a stock deviates too much from its mean buy/sell that stock). Run a 
  simulation on this data and portfolio contents over the previous year and see what the earnings would 
  have looked like.
