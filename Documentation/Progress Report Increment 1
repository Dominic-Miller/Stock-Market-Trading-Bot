Progress Report
- Increment 1 -
Group #14

1) Team Members
- Kian Haghighi (FSU ID: kh21e, GitHub ID: KianHaghighi)
- Dominic Miller (FSU ID: dgm21, Github ID: Dominic-Miller)

2) Project Title and Description
- Stock Market Trading Bot
- The idea behind this project is to develop a web application where users can go in and create their 
  own portfolio of stocks from a handful of available options to be traded by a ML bot. The bot will 
  track 1 minute tickers of the stock data and day trade based on the assumption a stock will always 
  fall back to its mean price (if a stock deviates too much from its mean buy/sell that stock). Run a 
  simulation on this data and portfolio contents over the previous year and see what the earnings would 
  have looked like.

3) Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment
Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands
overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed.
- 1. User Authentication and Registration
- 2. Real-Time Market Data
- 3. Basic Historical Data Analysis - visualizations, ratios, etc

4) Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this
increment
Please describe here in detail:
- anything that was challenging during this increment and how you dealt with the challenges
- any changes that occurred in the initial plan you had for the project or its scope. Describe the
reasons for the changes.
- anything that went wrong during this increment

5) Team Member Contribution for this increment
Please list each individual member and their contributions to each of the deliverables in this
increment (be as detailed as possible). In other words, describe the contribution of each team
member to:
a) the progress report, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
b) the requirements and design document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
c) the implementation and testing document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
d) the source code (be detailed about which parts of the system each team member contributed to
and how)
e) the video or presentation
- Dominic Miller: A) Wrote the description of our project, plans for our next increment, and contributed 
  to the challenges we faced in this increment for the progrss report document. B) C) 
  D) Set up the GitHub layout and created a group of issues that need to be addressed in this project. 
  Found the ticker data for a handful of stocks that will be useful in training our model and began 
  developing the trading bot's backend. E) 
- Kian Haghighi: A) B) C) D) E)
- Edwin Laguerre: A) B) C) D) E) 
- Ilya Kogan: A) B) C) D) E) 

6) Plans for the next increment
- In the next increment, we plan on fully implementing the backend for this project. This will include 
  writing all the code needed to train our ML bots and actually training our models so that when we
  finish our web application, we can simply connect the backend to this application and the simulations
  will run based on user input. We also plan to create the framework for our web application, like the user
  authentication, so once we get to increment 3 we can begin working immediately.
