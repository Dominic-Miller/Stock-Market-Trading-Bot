1. Overview

- The "Stock Market Trading Bot" is a web application designed to empower users with the ability to 
create and manage personalized stock portfolios. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the bot continually
monitors one-minute stock price data, executing day trading strategies based on the assumption that stock prices
will regress to their mean values when deviating significantly. Additionally, the system conducts simulations over
the past year's data to provide users with insights into potential earnings. To implement this trading bot, we have
developed a SVM Model (Support Vector Machine). SVM is a popular and effective machine learning algorithm for both 
classification and regression. The idea of SVM is to construct a hyperplane   to seperate the two classes of data with 
the gap being as wide as possible. Beyond portfolio management and algorithmic trading, the web application delivers 
real-time market data and stock-related news. The project's motivation stems from the desire to simulate real-time 
financial markets, offering users valuable insights into stock changes and visual representations of market fluctuations. 
The automated trading capabilities save time and enable the implementation of intricate trading strategies. Operating 
around the clock, the bot executes trades when users are unavailable and offers the ability to backtest trading strategies 
with historical data while mitigating irrational trading decisions influenced by emotions. It will provide a clear and 
intuitive dashboard that shows users the overview of the portfolio's performance, recent trades, and market trends 
presenting data in an easily digestable form.


2. Functional Requirements

Low Priority:
1. User Authentication
   - The system shall provide a user authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users accessing 
   the platform. This is of low priority as it is a fundamental security measure but not a core function 
   of the system.
2. User Registration
   - The system shall allow new users to register by providing necessary personal information. This is also 
   of low priority as it's essential but not a primary function.

Medium Priority:
3. Real-Time Market Data
   - The system shall provide real-time market data, including stock prices, indices, and relevant financial 
   information. This is of medium priority, as it is crucial for the system's functionality but not the    
   primary focus.
4. Data API
   - The system shall allow a user to input a stock's ticker, and return the stock's data for each 1 minute
   increment over 2022 and automatically save it to the data dump folder. This is essential data to feed into
   the ML algorithm.
   
High Priority:
5. Portfolio Management
   - The system shall allow users to create and manage investment portfolios, including adding and removing 
   assets, setting investment goals, and tracking performance. This is of high priority as it is a core 
   functionality of the system.
6. Historical Data Analysis
   - The system shall enable users to access and analyze historical market data, such as historical stock 
   prices and trends. This is also of high priority, as it supports decision-making and investment strategies 
   based on past performance.
7. Trading Signals
   - The system shall automatically know when to buy and sell a stock based upon its prediction for divergence
   and convergence of its two classes. To do this, we have developed trading signals which let the bot know
   if it would be a good time to buy or sell the stock based on price and volume to predict future outcomes.

- The prioritization is based on the criticality of the functions to the primary purpose of the system. User 
authentication and registration, while important, are not the primary focus of the system and are therefore 
low priority. Real-time market data is essential but secondary to the core functions of portfolio management 
and historical data analysis, which are of high priority because they are central to the system's purpose.


3. Non-functional Requirements

Non-Functional Requirements for the Stock Trading Bot:

1. Security:
   - The system shall implement robust security measures to protect user data, transactions, and sensitive 
   financial information. This is crucial to ensure the trust and safety of users' investments and personal data.

2. Performance:
   - The system shall provide low-latency access to real-time market data to ensure timely and accurate trading 
   decisions. High-performance trading execution is essential in the stock market.

3. Reliability:
   - The system shall maintain a high level of availability with minimal downtime to ensure that users can access 
   and use the platform consistently. Reliability is critical in the stock trading environment.

4. Scalability:
   - The system shall be designed to scale efficiently to accommodate a growing user base and increasing data volumes. 
   Scalability is important to handle increased demand.

5. Compliance:
   - The system shall comply with relevant financial regulations and industry standards, ensuring that all transactions 
   and activities adhere to legal requirements. Compliance is essential to avoid legal issues and protect users.

6. User Experience (UX):
   - The system shall provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for traders, offering ease of use and efficient 
   navigation. A positive user experience is crucial to attract and retain users.

7. Error Handling:
   - The system shall have robust error-handling mechanisms to prevent trading errors, data inconsistencies, and system 
   failures. Proper error handling ensures the system's stability.

8. Data Accuracy:
   - The system shall ensure the accuracy and integrity of all market data and transaction records. Reliable data is 
   critical for making informed investment decisions.

9. Software Quality:
   - The system shall adhere to industry best practices for software development, including code quality, testing, 
   and maintainability. High-quality software reduces the likelihood of bugs and enhances long-term sustainability.

10. Data Privacy:
    - The system shall protect user privacy by implementing data encryption, user consent mechanisms, and adherence to 
   privacy laws. Maintaining data privacy is vital for user trust and regulatory compliance.

11. Disaster Recovery:
    - The system shall have a disaster recovery plan in place to ensure data backup, redundancy, and a quick recovery 
   in case of system failures or disasters. This is essential to minimize downtime and data loss.


- Rationale: These non-functional requirements are essential for the stock trading bot to provide a secure, 
reliable, and efficient trading platform. Each requirement is derived from industry standards and practices 
to ensure the system's success and user satisfaction. The specific nature of these requirements 
is critical for the successful operation of a stock trading bot and to meet the needs and expectations of traders.


4. Use Case Diagram

This section presents the use case diagram and the textual descriptions of the use cases for
the system under development. The use case diagram should contain all the use cases and
relationships between them needed to describe the functionality to be developed. If you discover
new use cases between two increments, update the diagram for your future increments.
Textual descriptions of use cases: For the first increment, the textual descriptions for the use
cases are not required. However, the textual descriptions for all use cases discovered for your
system are required for the second and third iterations.


5. Class Diagram and/or Sequence Diagrams

This section presents a high-level overview of the anticipated system architecture using a class
diagram and/or sequence diagrams.
If the main paradigm used in your project is Object Oriented (i.e., you have classes or
something that acts similar to classes in your system), then draw the Class Diagram of the
entire system and Sequence Diagrams for the three (3) most important use cases in your
system.
If the main paradigm in your system is not Object Oriented (i.e., you do not have classes or
anything similar to classes in your system) then only draw Sequence Diagrams, but for all the
use cases of your system. In this case, we will use a modified version of Sequence Diagrams,
where instead of objects, the lifelines will represent the functions in the system involved in the
action sequence.
Class Diagrams show the fundamental objects/classes that must be modeled with the system
to satisfy its requirements and the relationships between them. Each class rectangle on the
diagram must also include the attributes and the methods of the class (they can be refined
between increments). All the relationships between classes and their multiplicity must be
shown on the class diagram.
A Sequence Diagram simply depicts interaction between objects (or functions - in our case -
for non-OOP systems) in a sequential order, i.e. the order in which these interactions take place.
Sequence diagrams describe how and in what order the objects in a system function.


6. Operating Environment

- The software will operate on standard hardware platforms running compatible operating systems, such as Windows 10, 
macOS 12, and Linux Ubuntu 20.04. It must peacefully coexist with other software components and applications commonly
found on these platforms, including web browsers, database management systems, and security software 


7. Assumptions and Dependencies

1. Market Data Providers: The project assumes that reliable third-party market data providers will be 
   available to source real-time and historical market data. Any issues with these data providers, including 
   data accuracy and availability, could affect the functionality of the system.

2. Data Privacy Regulations: It is assumed that the project complies with existing data privacy regulations. 
   Changes in data privacy laws or regulations may necessitate updates to the system to ensure continued compliance.

3. Internet Connectivity: The system relies on stable internet connectivity for users to access real-time market data 
   and execute trades. Any disruptions in internet connectivity may affect the user experience.

4. Third-Party APIs: The project may depend on third-party APIs for various functionalities, such as payment processing, 
   news feeds, or communication with stock exchanges. Assumptions about the reliability and continued support of these 
   APIs could impact the system's performance and functionality.

6. Infrastructure Scalability: Assumptions about the scalability of the underlying infrastructure need to hold true. Any 
   limitations in scalability could affect the system's ability to handle a growing user base.

8. Financial Market Volatility: The project assumes that the stock market will continue to operate in a reasonably stable
   manner. Unexpected market volatility can significantly impact the performance and behavior of the trading bot.

9. Legal and Regulatory Changes: Assumptions about the stability of financial regulations need to hold true. Changes in 
   regulations or unexpected legal issues could require modifications to the system to ensure compliance.


10. User Adoption: The success of the project assumes that users will adopt the trading bot as expected. If user adoption 
   rates are significantly different from what was anticipated, it could affect the system's scalability and resource requirements.

11. Integration with Brokerage Accounts: If the project intends to integrate with external brokerage accounts, it assumes 
   that these integrations will be technically feasible and that the brokerage firms will support such integrations.
