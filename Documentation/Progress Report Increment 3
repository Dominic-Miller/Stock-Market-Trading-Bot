2) Project Title and Description
- Stock Market Trading Bot
- The idea behind this project is to develop a web application where users can go in and create their 
  own portfolio of stocks from a handful of available options to be traded by a ML bot. The bot will 
  track 1 minute tickers of the stock data and day trade based on the assumption a stock will always 
  fall back to its mean price (if a stock deviates too much from its mean buy/sell that stock). Run a 
  simulation on this data and portfolio contents over the previous year and see what the earnings would 
  have looked like.

5) Team Member Contribution for this increment
- Dominic Miller: A) Wrote the majority of the progress report document including the project desription,
  OU, Framework, Info, Training, and Simulation accomplishments. Also the Linear Regression, Math Functions,
  and Profit/Loss Dataframe challenges and the Backend & Frontend Split changes along with this part. 
  B) Wrote the changes and updates to the requirements & design document along with updates to the diagrams. 
  C) Wrote the entirety of edits to the implementation and testing document since the last increment along 
  with updates to execution-based functional testing, execution-based non-functional testing, and 
  non-executional-based testing parts. D) Wrote the entirety of our backend source code including the 
  O_U.py file, Framework.ipynb file, updates to Trading_Signals.py, processed and info data dumps, and much 
  more. E) Did the intro and overview of the current project in our increment's video. Also discussed the 
  state of the backend,what was accomplished on the backend, a demo of the backend, our changes of scope, 
  and an overview of the completed backend for this project.
