# We will use Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to model the residual term because the O-U process is a
# stochastic process such that the object modeled by the process always drifts towards its long-term mean.

# Take in raw data and turn it into training and testing windows for the ML model
# Also properly model the price residuals
